fix: update ClientAuthCheck to read fallback cookie

- ClientAuthCheck now checks both localStorage and auth-token-fallback cookie
- Added getCookie helper function to read cookies from document.cookie
- Added detailed logging for token sources
- This fixes the issue where users couldn't access admin after login

The fallback cookie is working (visible in browser), but ClientAuthCheck
was only checking localStorage. Now it checks both sources.
